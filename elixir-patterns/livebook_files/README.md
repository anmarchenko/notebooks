# Elixir Patterns Livebook Guides

## Introduction

The Livebook files that are bundled with the Elixir Patterns book are meant to help you learn and experiment
with some of the material that is covered in the text. In addition, they can also act as useful references
if you ever need to remind yourself how to do something.

## Getting started

Using Livebook is super easy. All you need to do is run a few CLI commands
and you'll be up and running in no time.

1. Start off by setting up Hex and Rebar: `mix local.rebar --force && mix local.hex --force`
2. Then install Livebook so that it is globally accessible: `mix escript.install hex livebook`
3. Run the Livebook server with: `livebook server`
4. Copy and paste the URL that is generated from the previous command in the browser
5. Using the Livebook file system navigator, open up any of the accompanying Elixir Patterns files and start
   experimenting!
